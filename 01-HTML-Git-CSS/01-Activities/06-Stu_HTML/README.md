## üí° Hints

How can you use header elements to define the most important heading and the subheaders? H1 tags are used to denote the most important text, such as the main theme or title of a content. H2 and H3 tags are commonly used as subheadings. Finally, H4, H5, and H6 tags may be used to provide further structure within those subsections.

How will using different header elements impact the size of the text?
Header elements don't define the size. Size must be change by using font size.

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are the advantages of using semantic elements in your HTML?

The pages made with semantic elements are much easier to read.
It has greater accessibility. It offers a better user experience.
